# Bullet-Hell-Jam-5-Consequences
 A game made for the Bullet Hell Jam 5 game jam with the prompt of "consequences."

 This game is a bullet hell where the player pilots a ship with a faulty shield. The shield bounces back projectiles towards the player and allows more to enter instead of the reverse.

 In the case I continue working on this, I plan on adding more interesting enemies, powerups, and improve the art and audio.

 The biggest things I learned from doing this are the the importance of audio, the importance of time management during a game jam, and how to use Godot, GDScript, and Itch.io.
